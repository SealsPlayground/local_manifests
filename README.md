local_manifests
===============

local_manifests for exynos 982x devices

This goes in /android/system/.repo/local_manifests/roomservice.xml
(or wherever you initialized android source to begin with)

roomservice_ota.xml is used by me for otas, you porobably dont want to use it

you can find signature spoofing patches used on repo https://github.com/SealsPlayground/patches
